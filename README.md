# JavaScript-capstone-project

The JavaScript capstone project is about building our own web application based on an external API. The webapp have 3 user interfaces:

- A home page showing a list of items that you can "like."
- A popup window with more data about an item that you can use to comment on it.
- In this project we pratice giving code reviews to our teammates.
- We built an API that provides data about movies and then build the webpack app around it. 
- We use Jest to test the counters of comments and likes.

### Project requirements
- You should build these interfaces:
  - The *home page*.
  - The *comments popup*.
- You should follow the layout of the wireframes provided. You should personalize the rest of the design including colors, typographies, spacings, etc.
- Home page
  - When the page loads, the webapp retrieves data from:
    - The selected API and shows the list of items on screen.
    - The Involvement API to show the item likes.
  - Remember that your page should make only 2 requests:
    - One to the base API.
    - And **one** to the Involvement API.
  - When the user clicks on the Like button of an item, the interaction is recorded in the Involvement API and the screen is updated.
  - When the user clicks on the "Comments" button, the Comments popup appears.
  - Home page header and navigation similar to the given mockup.
  - Home page footer similar to the given mockup.
- Comments popup
  - When the popup loads, the webapp retrieves data from:
    - The selected API and shows details about the selected item.
    - The Involvement API to show the item comments.
  - When the user clicks on the "Comment" button, the data is recorded in the Involvement API and the screen is updated.

**Counters**
We have counters in all the interfaces that show:
- The number of items (home).
- The number of comments (comments popup).
